# L1 and L2 Regularization

These are slides for a lecture I gave at NYU Poly in March of 2015 for a Machine Learning course

Along with the code to build the slides (written in LaTeX), I have also provided some code to run a simulation and model for an old Kaggle competition using Amazon's Employee Access Data.
